# Magnetic_Grapher

Created this because our physics teacher likes this kind of graphic representations of field lines.

Graphing the magnetic field lines of wires with current on.

You can add wires by pressing "a" and delete a wire by pressing "d" when your mouse is on it.

You can grab a wire by clicking on it once, and let it go by clicking again.
